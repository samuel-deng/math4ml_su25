# Course Skeleton
{: .no_toc }
This is lecture-by-lecture skeleton of the course meant to organize and bullet
point what we've learned so far in each class. It is not meant to replace notes
or going to class; it is here as a resource to help you, the student, have a bird's
eye view of the course's main ideas, definitions, and results.
