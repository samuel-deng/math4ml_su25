# Lecture Pacing
In my experience, it's really easy to get lost in a math class, especially if it is cumulative. At the same time, it can
be intimidating to interrupt the class with a question or comment (although you are really encouraged to do so at anytime)!
Because of this, during every lecture, I'll have a fully anonymous interactive poll to keep an eye on how people 
are feeling during lecture and I'll check it intermittently, especially during proofs. I encourage you to ask questions
whenever during a lecture, but this is a "lower stakes" way of giving pace feedback that I will incorporate.

When prompted, for a sign-in, just  click *"Skip for now."* You should be able to click on one of three colored circles
and revise your choice at any time live during the lecture.
