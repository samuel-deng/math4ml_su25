# Course Skeleton
{: .no_toc }
This page includes the main proof from each lecture that (in my
opinion) would be most valuable to understand how to reproduce by heart. By
design, each lecture contains a proof that pulls together most of the important
ideas in that lecture's notes, and being able to prove the main result yourself
(without referring back to the notes) would be a good indication that you have a
good grasp of the material in that lecture.

Each proof below includes an outline of the main "ingredients" in proving each
result, in bullet points.

It might be helpful to use this page to gauge your understanding of a set of
lecture notes when reviewing them. To systematically use this page, the
following "drill" might help:

1. Read over the theorem statement and identify the premises (the "if" parts)
   and the conclusion (the "then" part). Write them clearly on some piece of
   paper.
2. Read over the proof of the theorem statement in the lecture notes, and try to
   "chunk" or compartmentalize the big ideas in the proof into single sentences.
   You'll notice that a lot of the "filler" of a proof includes mechanical
   details that you might instinctively do if you knew the big idea guideposts
   (i.e. cancelling terms out, expanding squares, etc.). Write out your "chunked"
   understanding of the proof on your piece of paper.
3. Compare your "chunks" for the proof to the ingredients I have listed below.
   Synthesize your own understanding with these ingredients and write down a
   short summary (in your own words) of the key steps in the proof, ommitting
   any "filler" that you are confident that you can do yourself by instinct.
4. Try writing out the proof with *only* this synthesized summary as a guide.
   Make sure you don't skip steps and can justify each line. If you get really
   stuck, refer back to the acutal proof in the lecture notes as an "answer key."
5. Finally, try writing out the proof without referring to either the
   synthesized summary or the lecture notes. If you can do this, you can be
   pretty confident that you've learned the proof by heart!

I'll upload a video example of me doing this for one of these proofs so the
process is more clear.
